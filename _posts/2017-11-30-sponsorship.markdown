### A sponsorship letter I used when I was a board member for a student organization. Hope this can help anyone who are in need.

<hr>
Dear sir/madam,							 

I hope this email finds you doing great!

I am writing to you, on behalf of xxxx at xxxx University, to sincerely request your kind consideration of becoming a sponsor for our operations during the next academic year (xxxx-xxxx). 

xxxx is a non-profit organization that advocates the interests and addresses the concerns of its graduate student members. It develops to become one of the biggest communities that gathers the students from not only xxxx University but also the big xxxx area to learn, to talk, to play, and to live. As of today, our organization has more than xxxx mail-list subscribers, around xxxx Facebook/Twitter followers, who are directly served by our xx committee members in charge of various divisions including career development, cultural affairs, and social activities.

The organization and the students it serves can directly benefit from your supports in many possible ways. For example, in the upcoming holiday season, we would act as a welcoming home to invite all the students and their family to a big Thanksgiving dinner, and your helping hands will instantly turn into the major parts of it. With more sponsorship, more activities and events like this can be organized, more students can be influenced, and more lives can be changed. 

Your kind support, in any form, is the heart to our community and will be highly appreciated. Your sponsorship will be reflected on our Facebook page as well as any of the upcoming events of the academic year.

If you are interested, please don't hesitate to contact us at xxxx or xxxx. Thank you very much!

Best,

xxxx
